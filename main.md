# Introduction

This specification .... 

# Terminology

Credential

A set of one or more claims made by an issuer (see [@VC_DATA]). Note that this definition differs from that in [@OpenID].

Verifiable Credential (VC)

A verifiable credential is a tamper-evident credential that has authorship that can be cryptographically verified. Verifiable credentials can be used to build verifiable presentations, which can also be cryptographically verified (see [@VC_DATA]).

Presentation

Data derived from one or more verifiable credentials, issued by one or more issuers, that is shared with a specific verifier (see [@VC_DATA]).

Verified Presentation (VP)

A verifiable presentation is a tamper-evident presentation encoded in such a way that authorship of the data can be trusted after a process of cryptographic verification. Certain types of verifiable presentations might contain data that is synthesized from, but do not contain, the original verifiable credentials (for example, zero-knowledge proofs) (see [@VC_DATA]).
